A small collection of Python assignment solutions created while learning programming.

## 💡 About
This repository contains short, self-contained Python scripts organized by assignment. Each file demonstrates a focused concept (input/output, data types, control flow, functions, etc.) suitable for beginners.

## 🗂️ Structure
- `Assignment1/`
  - `program1.py` — example solution for Assignment 1
- `Assignment2/`
  - `que1.py` — display value, type, and memory address of a variable
  - `que2.py` — show identity behavior for immutables vs mutables using `id()`
  - `que6.py` — simple calculator (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - `que9.py` — greet user and show next-year age
- `Assignment3/`
  - `que1.py`, `que6.py` — additional exercises
- `Assignment4/` — (empty / to be added)

> Descriptions are brief; open the individual files for full problem statements and implementation details.
